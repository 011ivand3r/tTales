[{"content":"Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Hans Ollivander (Han5 011ivand3r). I am a student and dreamer. As a student, I ask questions and seek for digestible answers. Generally, it is followed by me trying to contradict my brain with wrong answers. And a dreamer, because that\u0026rsquo;s where freedom is.\nI am passionate about human space exploration, machine learning and storytelling. I often find myself dabbling in the reality of fickleness of carbon-based life on planet Earth. I consume books, articles, podcasts and documentaries on them. And talk to people about them (Not as much I want to! So why not get in touch!).\nI enjoy running and playing chess. Although, I\u0026rsquo;m quite a noob at both. But, I hope to participate in some events in future. And of course, I sleep a lot.\n Enough about me. tTales is all about dumping my thoughts and opinions into one place on the internet.\ntTales is created with HUGO. The theme I\u0026rsquo;m using is minimo. I customized it as per my needs, and it\u0026rsquo;s currently hosted on GitHub. The reason I chose minimo over other themes is the search bar and obviously the UI üòç.\nCheck out the HUGO site. They have hundreds of exciting themes, and it\u0026rsquo;s built on Go. So, it\u0026rsquo;s faster than other static site generators and very easy to set up. Now that I‚Äôve justified my choices, thanks for visiting my website!\nGet in touch using any of the links in the footer!\n","href":"/tTales/about/","title":"About"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/authors/","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/categories/","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/page/","title":"Pages"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/posts/","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/search/","title":"Search"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/series/","title":"Series"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/tags/","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/","title":"tTales"}]
