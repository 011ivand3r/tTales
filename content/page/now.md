Staying home and avoiding Covid-19.

And trying to stay away from negative news channels, as much as possible. Everyone has some agenda of their own. Everyone wants to prove that their handling of the pandemic is somehow better than all others. It's just sickening!

## Hauptfokus

I am working on a piece of software that will be able to make videos by itself (only a specific type of video). I'm also taking an online course by Jeremy Howard, [Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders](http://course18.fast.ai/ml).

Apart from all that, just trying to keep up with the quizzes and assignments.

## Ich lese

[**The Fellowship of the Ring:**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34.The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring) This is the first book of The Lord of the Rings series, by J. R. R. Tolkien obviously. I have watched the Hobbit series of movies. But that's all I know about Middle Earth. I hope by the time lockdown ends, I'm ready to watch the films.
