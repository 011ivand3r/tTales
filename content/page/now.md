Staying home and avoiding Covid-19.

And trying to stay away from negative news channels, as much as possible. Everyone has some agenda. Which is just sickening!

## Hauptfokus

I am working on a piece of software that will be able to make videos by itself(only a specific type of video). I'm also doing an online course by Jeremy Howard, [Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders](http://course18.fast.ai/ml).

Apart from all that, just trying to keep up with the quizzes and assignments. Which is painstakingly hard in this lockdown.

## Tranieren

Gnerally I prefer running with a bit of stretching. But under current circumstances, I'm just doing some home workout. Here's an example of what I'm doing:

- Warm up (to avoid injuries)
- Squats
- Jumping lunges
- Russian twists
- Plank (normal and side)
- Leg raises (normal and side)
- Cool down stretches

After that, lot's of water :sweat:.

## Ich lese

[**The Fellowship of the Ring:**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34.The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring) This is the first book of The Lord of the Rings series, by J.R.R.Tolkien obviuosly. I have wathced the Hobbit series of movies. But that's all I know about Middle Earth. I hope by the time lockdown ends, I'm ready to watch the films.
