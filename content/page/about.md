Hallo! Ich hei√üe Sycroft Holmes.

I am a rather undistinguished Mechanical Engineering student at a particular public institute situated in India. My daily life consists primarily of schoolwork. The other goals I work on are my mental health, physical health, and reading books. My reading strategy doesn't allow me to take up random books that come as suggestions from Bookstagrammers or Booktubers. I am the one to choose a topic, then find out suggested books to know more about the subject, finally devouring them until I get an ok idea.

I am a sports analytics enthusiast. I love the way data has powered modern-day sportspersons to break the preconceived limits of the human body and mind. My hope is data will do the same for other spheres of *Homo sapiens* life. I like to follow the news too. Not breaking news, which is itself broken to its core due to the broken business model most media houses have. I read articles; yes, you guessed right! The articles by people who have reached the intellectual status of human society.

By the way, if you ever come across my brother Mycroft, don't forget to tell him that I adore him!

That's all! Thanks for bearing with my narcissism.
