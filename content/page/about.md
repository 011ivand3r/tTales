Hi, I'm **Hans Ollivander (Han5 011ivand3r)**. I am a student and dreamer. As a student, I ask questions and seek for digestible answers. Generally, it is followed by me trying to contradict my brain with wrong answers. And a dreamer, because that's where freedom is.

I am passionate about human space exploration, machine learning and storytelling. I often find myself dabbling in the reality of fickleness of carbon-based life on planet Earth. I consume books, articles, podcasts and documentaries on them. And talk to people about them (Not as much I want to! So why not get in touch!).

I enjoy running and playing chess. Although, I'm quite a noob at both. But, I hope to participate in some events in future. And of course, I sleep a lot.

Enough about me. **tTales** is all about dumping my thoughts and opinions into one place on the internet.

tTales is created with HUGO. The theme I'm using is [minimo](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimo/). I customized it as per my needs, and it's currently hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/han5-011ivand3r/tTales). The reason I chose minimo over other themes is the search bar and obviously the UI :heart_eyes:.

Check out the [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) site. They have hundreds of exciting themes, and it's built on [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)). So, it's [faster](https://gohugo.io/about/what-is-hugo/#how-fast-is-hugo) than other static site generators and very easy to set up. Now that Iâ€™ve justified my choices, thanks for visiting my website!
