Hi, **hans durk (han5 dürk)** here!

I'm a rather undistinguished Mechanical Engineering student at an Institute, enrolled with my official name(not han5 dürk). Currently, I am currently creating a Fantasy Premier League points prediction engine.

I generally divide my time between sleep, schoolwork, coding and making YouTube videos. I am passionate about human space exploration, machine learning and storytelling. I listen to podcasts, read books and articles, and watch videos on them. I also make [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYvbqYvGvhXCoIud49NfvKA) on (football/soccer + data science).

I often find myself dabbling in the reality of fickleness of carbon-based life on planet Earth. If you share somewhat similar thoughts/interests, go to the bottom of the page and hit me up!

Enough about me.

**tTales** is created with HUGO. The theme I'm using is [minimo](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimo/). I customized it as per my needs, and it's currently hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/han5durk/tTales). The reason I chose minimo over other themes is the search bar and obviously the UI :heart_eyes:.

Check out the [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) site. They have hundreds of exciting themes, and it's built on [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)). So, it's [faster](https://gohugo.io/about/what-is-hugo/#how-fast-is-hugo) than other static site generators and easy to set up. Now that I’ve justified my choices, thanks for visiting my website!
