Hi, **hans durk (han5 durk)** here!

I'm a rather undistinguished Mechanical Engineering student at IIT Kharagpur, enrolled as **Shubham Hansda** (not han5 durk). Currently, I am taking classes like Systems & Controls and creating a Fantasy Premier League points prediction engine.

I generally divide my time between sleep, schoolwork, coding and making YouTube videos. I am passionate about human space exploration, machine learning and storytelling. I often find myself dabbling in the reality of fickleness of carbon-based life on planet Earth. I listen to podcasts, read articles, books and watch videos on them. If you want to talk about such stuff, go to the bottom of the page and get in touch!

By principle, I'm a student and a dreamer. Being a student, I ask questions and seek for digestible answers. Generally, it is followed by me trying to contradict my brain with mostly wrong answers. And a dreamer, because that's where freedom is.

I also make YouTube videos on (football/soccer + data science). Visit my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYvbqYvGvhXCoIud49NfvKA) for more.

Enough about me.

**tTales** is created with HUGO. The theme I'm using is [minimo](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimo/). I customized it as per my needs, and it's currently hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/han5durk/tTales). The reason I chose minimo over other themes is the search bar and obviously the UI :heart_eyes:.

Check out the [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) site. They have hundreds of exciting themes, and it's built on [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)). So, it's [faster](https://gohugo.io/about/what-is-hugo/#how-fast-is-hugo) than other static site generators and easy to set up. Now that Iâ€™ve justified my choices, thanks for visiting my website!
