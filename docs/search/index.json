[{"content":"Staying home and avoiding Covid-19.\nAnd trying to stay away from negative news channels, as much as possible. Everyone has some agenda. Which is just sickening!\nHauptfokus I am working on a piece of software that will be able to make videos by itself(only a specific type of video). I\u0026rsquo;m also doing an online course by Jeremy Howard, Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders.\nApart from all that, just trying to keep up with the quizzes and assignments. Which is painstakingly hard in this lockdown.\nTranieren Gnerally I prefer running with a bit of stretching. But under current circumstances, I\u0026rsquo;m just doing some home workout. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of what I\u0026rsquo;m doing:\n Warm up (to avoid injuries) Squats Jumping lunges Russian twists Plank (normal and side) Leg raises (normal and side) Cool down stretches  After that, lot\u0026rsquo;s of water üòì.\nIch lese The Fellowship of the Ring: This is the first book of The Lord of the Rings series, by J.R.R.Tolkien obviuosly. I have wathced the Hobbit series of movies. But that\u0026rsquo;s all I know about Middle Earth. I hope by the time lockdown ends, I\u0026rsquo;m ready to watch the films.\n","href":"/tTales/now/","title":"Now"},{"content":"Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m Hans Ollivander (Han5 011ivand3r). I am a student and creator. As a student, I like diving deep into my topics of interest. And by creator, I don\u0026rsquo;t mean making magic wands. I mean creating doodles, writing and making silly softwares.\nI am passionate about human space exploration, machine learning and visual design. I spend a lot of my time thinking, what makes humans the way they are. I read books and articles on them. And talk to a lot of people about them (Not as much I want to! So why not get in touch!).\nHipHop and Indian classical instrumentals populate most of my playlist.\nRecently I have started to enjoy running and playing chess. I hope to participate in some events in future. And of course, I sleep a lot.\n Enough about me. tTales is all about dumping my thoughts and opinions into one place on the internet.\ntTales is created with HUGO. The theme I\u0026rsquo;m using is minimo. I customized it as per my needs, and it\u0026rsquo;s currently hosted on GitHub. The reason I chose minimo over other themes is the search bar and obviously the UI üòç.\nCheck out the HUGO site. They have hundreds of exciting themes, and it\u0026rsquo;s built on Go. So, it\u0026rsquo;s faster than other static site generators and very easy to set up. Now that I‚Äôve justified my choices, thanks for visiting my website!\nGet in touch using any of the links in the footer!\n","href":"/tTales/about/","title":"About"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/tags/books/","title":"books"},{"content":"This pandemic is putting things in perspective.
