[{"content":"Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Hans Ollivander (han5 011ivand3r). I am a student and dreamer. As a student, I ask questions and seek for digestible answers. Generally, it is followed by me trying to contradict my brain with wrong answers. And a dreamer, because that\u0026rsquo;s where freedom is.\nI am passionate about human space exploration, machine learning and storytelling. I often find myself dabbling in the reality of fickleness of carbon-based life on planet Earth. I consume books, articles, podcasts and documentaries on them. And talk to people about them (Not as much I want to! So why not get in touch!).\nI enjoy running and playing chess. Although, I\u0026rsquo;m quite a novice at both. But, I hope to participate in some events in future. And of course, I sleep a lot.\n Enough about me. tTales is all about dumping my thoughts and opinions into one place on the internet.\ntTales is created with HUGO. The theme I\u0026rsquo;m using is minimo. I customized it as per my needs, and it\u0026rsquo;s currently hosted on GitHub. The reason I chose minimo over other themes is the search bar and obviously the UI üòç.\nCheck out the HUGO site. They have hundreds of exciting themes, and it\u0026rsquo;s built on Go. So, it\u0026rsquo;s faster than other static site generators and very easy to set up. Now that I‚Äôve justified my choices, thanks for visiting my website!\nGet in touch using any of the links in the footer!\n","href":"/tTales/about/","title":"About"},{"content":"Magic with Moviepy How to make vErY sLiCk Harry Potter edits with Python code Cool Video-Editing setupThis setup is not mine. I just wanted a video editing setup picture. So, that‚Äôs that. Now let‚Äôs talk about what I did and how I did that.\nThe end goal is to create a video somewhat like this.\nStep 1 Collect some video clips of the characters belonging to some particular Hogwarts House you want to make a video of. Then put all of them in a folder and place the folder in the same directory as your python file is.\nStep 2 Start writing the code.\nFirstly, we import a bunch of things. os for working with files, randint for taking random snippets from videos, moviepy for making the video, itertools for iterating through a folder, and word_list for the word overlays.\nWe need 3 inputs ‚Äî Duration of the video, name of the music file, \u0026amp; the name of the folder in which all the video-clips are.\nThen we define the path to the video-clips folder as VID_DIR , where you put a bunch of clips of that you want to use in the video. Also, define the path to the final video that is going to be produced as ‚Äúfinal-video.mp4‚Äù.\nWe also add some overlays that we can use on the video to make it look more professional.\nWe make another python file in the same directory, words.py which will contain the words that we want to overlay on. We had already imported this list in our main code as you‚Äôll see on the code snippet above.\nThen we define, a class as Potions_pot and initialize a bunch of variables in the constructor class, to be used later on in the functions that we define.\nWe define thegenerate function, calling three other functions ‚Äî add_clip(), word_overlay(), and add_music() so that we can just call the generate function later to get the work done.\nLet‚Äôs talk about add_clips() function.\nHere, we basically take the files in VID_DIR and loop through them. Each file is taken and a subclip is generated of random duration, not more than 10 seconds. Then we overlay it with whatever overlay you‚Äôd like to have. We keep track of the subclip duration and keep on adding clips until the desired_duration is reached.\nThen we put on some word overlays using the word_overlay function.\nWe take in the words from the word_list imported from words.py and then layer it over the video that was generated by the add_clips() function. Also, we add an intro_text according to the Hogwarts house, we are making the video of. Finally, we concatenate the intro_text and the word overlayed video. Thus, get the full video only waiting for a piece of matching music to be added in the background.\nWhich we do by add_music function. We get the duration of the whole video, cut a part of the music_file and add to it using set_audio() function.\nTo make it work, we instantiate the Potions_pot class and pass in the music_file and vid_directory to it. And call the function generate. And you‚Äôll get a video in the same directory as the python file.\nStep 3 Create something new, and share it with everyone.\nThank you for reading! I hope you enjoyed it.\nHere are some videos that I generated using it: Youtube playlist link.\n","href":"/tTales/posts/moviepy/","title":"Moviepy"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/posts/","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/","title":"tTales"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/authors/","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/categories/","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/page/","title":"Pages"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/search/","title":"Search"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/series/","title":"Series"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/tags/","title":"Tags"}]
