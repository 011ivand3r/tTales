As a student, I like diving deep into my topics of interest. And by creator, I don\u0026rsquo;t mean making magic wands. I mean creating doodles, writing and making silly softwares.\nI am passionate about human space exploration, machine learning and visual design. I spend a lot of my time thinking, what makes humans the way they are. I read books and articles on them. And talk to people who share those interests (Not a lot! So why not get in touch!).\nHipHop and Indian classical instrumentals populate most of my playlist.\nRecently I have started to enjoy running and playing chess. I hope to participate in some events in future. And of course, I sleep a lot.\n Enough about me. tTales is all about dumping my thoughts and opinions into one place on the internet.\ntTales is created with HUGO. The theme I\u0026rsquo;m using is minimo. I customized it as per my needs, and it\u0026rsquo;s currently hosted on GitHub. The reason I chose minimo over other themes is the search bar and obviously the UI üòç.\nCheck out the HUGO site. They have hundreds of exciting themes, and it\u0026rsquo;s built on Go. So, it\u0026rsquo;s faster than other static site generators and very easy to set up. Now that I‚Äôve justified my choices, thanks for visiting my website!\nGet in touch using any of the links in the footer!\n","href":"/tTales/about/","title":"About"},{"content":"","href":"/tTales/tags/books/","title":"books"},{"content":"This pandemic is putting things in perspective.
