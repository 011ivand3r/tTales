      <description>Whenever one starts learning about Machine Learning algorithms the first thing one learns is Linear Regression. But the way people generally blaze through it because it&amp;rsquo;s rudimentary and label it as very intuitive doesn&amp;rsquo;t sit well with me. So, in this article we will build a Linear Regression model with the help of probability.
The main idea in a regression problem is to determine the strength of relation between a bunch of independent variables \(x = (x_1, x_2, &amp;hellip; x_n)\) and a dependent variable \(y\) (i.</description>
