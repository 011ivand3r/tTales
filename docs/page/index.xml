      <description>Staying home and avoiding Covid-19.
And trying to stay away from negative news channels, as much as possible. Everyone has some agenda. Which is just sickening!
Hauptfokus I am working on a piece of software that will be able to make videos by itself(only a specific type of video). I&amp;rsquo;m also doing an online course by Jeremy Howard, Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders.
Apart from all that, just trying to keep up with the quizzes and assignments.</description>

      <description>Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m Hans Ollivander (Han5 011ivand3r). I am a student and creator. As a student, I like diving deep into my topics of interest. And by creator, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean making magic wands. I mean creating doodles, writing and making silly softwares.
I am passionate about human space exploration, machine learning and visual design. I spend a lot of my time thinking, what makes humans the way they are. I read books and articles on them.</description>
